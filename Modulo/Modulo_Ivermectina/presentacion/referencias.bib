abstract = {Aims: The anthelminthic ivermectin is receiving new attention as it is being repurposed for new indications such as mass drug administrations for the treatment of scabies or in malaria vector control. As its pharmacokinetics are still poorly understood, we aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in plasma and dried blood spots (DBS), a sampling method better suited to field trials, with special focus on the influence of body composition and enterohepatic circulation. Methods: We performed a clinical trial in 12 healthy volunteers who each received a single oral dose of 12 mg ivermectin, and collected peripheral venous and capillary DBS samples. We determined ivermectin concentrations in plasma and DBS by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a fully automated and scalable extraction system for DBS sample processing. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Results: A two-compartment model with a transit absorption model, first-order elimination, and weight as an influential covariate on central volume of distribution and clearance best described the data. The model estimates (inter-individual variability) for a 70 kg subject were: apparent population clearance 7.7 (25{\%}) l h −1 , and central and peripheral volumes of distribution 89 (10{\%}) l and 234 (20{\%}) l, respectively. Concentrations obtained from DBS samples were strongly linearly correlated (R 2  = 0.97) with plasma concentrations, and on average 30{\%} lower. Conclusion: The model accurately depicts population pharmacokinetics of plasma and DBS concentrations over time for oral ivermectin. The proposed analytical workflow is scalable and applicable to the requirements of mass drug administrations.},

abstract = {Background: Ivermectin is an older anthelminthic agent that is being studied more intensely given its potential for mass drug administration against scabies, malaria and other neglected tropical diseases. Its pharmacokinetics (PK) remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, the majority of PK trials are performed under fasted-state dosing conditions, and the effect of food is therefore not well known. To better plan and design field trials with ivermectin, a model that can account for both conditions would be valuable. Objectives: To develop a PK model and characterize the food effect with single oral doses of ivermectin. Patients and methods: We performed a population-based PK analysis of data pooled from two previous trials of a single dose of 12 mg ivermectin, one with dosing after a high-fat breakfast (n=12) and one with fasted-state dosing (n=3). Results: The final model described concentration-time profiles after fed and fasted dosing accurately, and estimated the food effect associated with relative bioavailability to 1.18 (95{\%} CI 1.10-1.67). Conclusions: In this analysis, the effect of a high-fat breakfast compared with a fasted-state administration of a single oral dose of 12 mg ivermectin was minimal.},

abstract = {Viral kinetic (VK) modeling has led to increased understanding of the within host dynamics of viral infections and the effects of therapy. Here we review recent developments in the modeling of viral infection kinetics with emphasis on two infectious diseases: hepatitis C and influenza. We review how VK modeling has evolved from simple models of viral infections treated with a drug or drug cocktail with an assumed constant effectiveness to models that incorporate drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as phenomenological models that simply assume drugs have time varying-effectiveness. We also discuss multiscale models that include intracellular events in viral replication, models of drug-resistance, models that include innate and adaptive immune responses and models that incorporate cell-to-cell spread of infection. Overall, VK modeling has provided new insights into the understanding of the disease progression and the modes of action of several drugs. We expect that VK modeling will be increasingly used in the coming years to optimize drug regimens in order to improve therapeutic outcomes and treatment tolerability for infectious diseases.},

abstract = {High-dose ivermectin, co-administered for 3 days with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), killed mosquitoes feeding on individuals for at least 28 days posttreatment in a recent trial (IVERMAL), whereas 7 days was predicted pretrial. The current study assessed the relationship between ivermectin blood concentrations and the observed mosquitocidal effects against Anopheles gambiae s.s. Three days of ivermectin 0, 300, or 600 mcg/kg/day plus DP was randomly assigned to 141 adults with uncomplicated malaria in Kenya. During 28 days of follow-up, 1,393 venous and 335 paired capillary plasma samples, 850 mosquito-cluster mortality rates, and 524 QTcF-intervals were collected. Using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, we show a consistent correlation between predicted ivermectin concentrations and observed mosquitocidal-effects throughout the 28-day study duration, without invoking an unidentified mosquitocidal metabolite or drug-drug interaction. Ivermectin had no effect on piperaquine's PKs or QTcF-prolongation. The PK/PD model can be used to design new treatment regimens with predicted mosquitocidal effect. This methodology could be used to evaluate effectiveness of other endectocides.},

abstract = {Background: A recent drug interaction study reported that when azithromycin was administered with the combination of ivermectin and alendazole, there was modest increasesin ivermectin pharmacokinetic parameters. Data from this study were reanalyzed to further explore this observation. A compartmental model was developed and 1,000 interaction studies were simulated to explore extreme high ivermectin values that might occur. Methods and Findings: A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination and absorption was developed. The chsen final model had 7 fixed-effect parameters and 8 random-effect parameters. Because some of the modeling parameters and their variances were not distributed normally, a second mixture model was developed to further explore these data. The mixture model had two additional fixed parameters and idntified two populations, A (55{\%} of subjects), where there was no change in bioavailability, and B (45{\%} of subjects), where ivermectin bioavailability was increased 37{\%}. Simulations of the data using both models were similar, and showed that the highest ivermectin concentrations fell in the range of 115-201 ng/mL. Conclusions: This is the first pharmacokinetic model of ivermectin. It demonstrates the utility of two modeling approaches to explore drug interactions, especially where there may be population heterogeneity. The mechanism for the interaction exposures that might be observed during co-administration with azithromycin are below those previously shown to be safe and well tolerated. These analyses support further study and co-administration of azithromycin with the widely used agents ivermectin and albendazole, under field conditions in disease control programs.{\textcopyright} 2008 El-Tahtawy et al.},

	abstract = {Serious neurological adverse events have been reported from large scale community-based ivermectin treatment campaigns against Onchocerciasis volvulus in Africa. The mechanism of these events has been debated in the literature, largely focusing on the role of concomitant infection with Loa loa versus the presence of mdr-1 gene variants in humans allowing ivermectin penetration into the central nervous system. A case series of serious neurological adverse events occurring with the use of ivermectin outside of the onchocerciasis indication has been identified in VigiBase, an international database of suspected adverse drug reactions. Forty-eight cases have been reported from multiple countries in which ivermectin has been prescribed for multiple indications; clinical review excluded 20 cases with more probable explanations or other exclusion criteria. Within the remaining 28 cases, there is supportive evidence for a causative role of ivermectin including presence of the drug in brain tissue in one case and recurrence of symptoms on repeated exposure in three cases. This series suggests that serious neurological adverse events observed with the use of ivermectin in the treatment of onchocerciasis may not be entirely explained by concomitant high burden loiasis infections. By comparison with the extensive post marketing experience with ivermectin in the successful treatment of parasitic infections, the number of reported cases suggests that such events are likely rare. However, elucidation of individual-level risk factors could contribute to therapeutic decisions that can minimize harms. Further investigation into the potential for drug-drug interactions and explorations of polymorphisms in the mdr-1 gene are recommended.},
